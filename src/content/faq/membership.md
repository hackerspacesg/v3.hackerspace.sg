### How is HackerspaceSG different from other co-working spaces? {#different}

HackerspaceSG isn’t like professional co-working spaces such as WeWork, JustCo, or Regus. We're a not-for-profit, community-driven space where learning and collaboration are key. Think of us more as a clubhouse or community centre where members can work, socialise, and share ideas.

Here’s what makes us different:

- Our members are here for more than just work — most of them are happy to socialise, collaborate, and build connections.
- We focus on creating a space for learning and sharing, not only in tech but also in fields like science, design, art, and lifehacking.
- Being community-run means there’s no formal service — you’ll be expected to clean up after yourself, and others will call you out if you don't.

If you thrive in a collaborative, DIY environment and don’t mind a bit of organised chaos, HackerspaceSG could be the perfect fit for you.

### What is included in the membership? {#included}

Your membership gets you 24/7 access to the space, so you can come anytime to work on your projects. Depending on your tier, you might also get shelf storage, lockers, a dedicated desk, a business address, and meeting room booking credits.

### What features does a membership provide over the other options? {#features}

Only members get 24/7 access to the space, and the ability to purchase both shelf storage and lockers.

If you are on our Supporter tier or a daily Desk Pass, you can't leave anything in the space when you leave for the day.

### Can I upgrade or downgrade my membership? {#change}

You can change your membership tier whenever you want. The new rate will start from the next billing cycle, unless you've been asked to upgrade for using the space too much.

### Is there a minimum commitment period? {#commitment}

The Community plan has a 2-month minimum commitment, and the Concessionary plan has a 3-month minimum commitment.

All other plans are month-to-month, except for the Supporter tier, which is billed annually.

### What are the requirements for the Concessionary tier? {#concessionary}

The Concessionary tier is for anyone earning less than $2,500 a month. We might ask for proof of eligibility.

### How do I book the meeting room, or host an event? {#booking}

If you have a private meeting or video call, you can book the meeting room through our internal Google Calendar <sup>(coming soon)</sup>. Each tier comes with a number of booking credits per month.

The meeting room doesn't need to be booked if you don't mind others entering to access the pantry or fridge.

To host a public or private event, email our Events team by following the instructions in our [handbook](https://docs.hackerspace.sg/handbook/hosting-events).

### What does "unlimited hours" mean? {#unlimited}

It means you can use the space 24/7! Just don’t spend more than 16 hours a day at the space — you can’t live here (we get it if there’s an occasional deadline though).

### What is a Desk Pass? {#deskpass}

A Desk Pass is for guests who use a desk or want access to our hardware/electronics room. It costs **$16** for the whole day. Members get 50% off for their guests. If a guest shares the desk that you're using, no pass is needed!

### Are there discounts for annual payments? {#annual}

If you pay for a year upfront, we’ll throw in some free months:

- Community tier: 1 month free
- Co-working tier: 2 months free
- Dedicated tier: 3 months free

### Can I add more storage or a locker to my membership? {#add-storage}

Yes, you can. Extra storage or lockers can be added for a small monthly fee. If your stuff takes up too much space, we might ask you to add storage anyway!

Check the [Add-ons section](#addons) for pricing details.

### What is Shelf Storage? {#shelf-storage}

As space is tight at HackerspaceSG, we ask members to keep their stuff in labelled boxes on shelves.

If your things don’t fit on a shelf (like big or odd-shaped items, or extremely heavy stuff) or need to be placed elsewhere, we’ll charge you a higher rate based on how much floor space you use.

Note that shelf storage is not secure. Please keep your valuables in lockers.

### What are the requirements for leaving equipment running, or using VPN access? {#equipment}

If you aren't on our Dedicated desk plan, your equipment needs to be stored either on the designated shelf, or in your personal storage when you leave the space for the day.

For all equipment left running on a shelf, we’ll need to verify your identity and get a written indemnity from you by email. Please label your equipment clearly with your name and contact information.

Your equipment is operated at your own risk. While unlikely, there’s a chance other members might (mis)handle it. Also, we can’t promise any uptime guarantees.

If your equipment uses a lot of electricity, we’ll ask you to pay your share of the costs.

### Can I bring and use my own chair, desk, or other furniture? {#furniture}

We may allow furniture to be brought in for shared use, on a case by case basis.

If the furniture is for your use only, we'll most likely ask you to upgrade to our Dedicated desk plan, and possibly also pay additional storage fees.

### Can I run a retail business from the space? {#retail}

Yes! However, your customers should only come in by appointment, and you will need to pay additional storage fees for any stock you keep in the space.
