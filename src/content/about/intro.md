# About HackerspaceSG

**HackerspaceSG** is Singapore's very own [Hackerspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace).

There are hundreds of such [hackerspaces](http://www.hackerspaces.org/) around the world, where people with common interests in computers, technology, science, engineering, and digital and electronic art, come together to meet, work, socialise and collaborate.

Built by and for geeks, nerds, inventors, engineers, and entrepreneurs, HackerspaceSG is the Singapore hacker community's home, living room and laboratory. Come hang out with the community in the evenings. Co-work with us during the day. We also host regular events, meetups, presentations, workshops, and movie nights for the local community.

HackerspaceSG was also Singapore's first co-working space. Since then, many more have appeared. While members are still able to co-work at HackerspaceSG, we try to stick to our roots of primarily being a space for the communities we serve.
