# Visiting HackerspaceSG

If you'd like to visit the space or [join as a member](/membership), drop by during an upcoming event, email us with your preferred visiting dates and times at contact@hackerspace.sg (please follow up if we don't reply), or ask if someone can host you on our [Telegram group chat](https://t.me/HackerspaceSG).

We welcome potential members and supporters, as well as foreign travellers (bonus points if you're a member of another hackerspace).

If you visit the space more than twice by appointment, please consider supporting us financially with either a membership or a supporter subscription, to help us pay our rent and bills.

If you want to use any of our desks or the hardware/electronics tools, you will need to buy a desk pass ($16) for the day.
