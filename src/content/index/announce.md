## Visiting the space ðŸ‘‹

_last updated: 12 May 2025_

HackerspaceSG is open 24/7 for members.

If you'd like to visit the space or [join as a member](/membership), drop by during [an upcoming event](/events), email us with your preferred visiting dates and times at contact@hackerspace.sg (please follow up if we don't reply), or ask if someone can host you on our [Telegram group chat](https://t.me/HackerspaceSG).

We moved into our new space at **Textile Centre, #08-10** 4 months ago, so it's still a bit messy around these parts (welcome to a hackerspace?). However, if you aren't looking for a conventional co-working space, maybe HackerspaceSG is for you?

As a not-for-profit organisation, we depend heavily on community support to keep going. If you like what we do, fill up the [HackerspaceSG 365](/365) form if you would like to pledge to support us!
