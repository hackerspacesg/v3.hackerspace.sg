DIY enthusiasts are also flocking to **Hackerspace**, a clubhouse for tinkerers and hackers in a Bussorah Street shophouse.

Since its inception in late 2009, Hackerspace now has a 300-strong mailing list and has grown from an initial 24 members to more than 60.

They pay between $32 and $512 for using the space, from a casual basis to permanent access seven days a week.
