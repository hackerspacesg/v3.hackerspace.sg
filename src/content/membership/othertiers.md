### Concessionary Tier

We have a Concessionary tier for individuals earning under $2,500/month, such as full-time students, NSFs, entrepreneurs just starting out, underemployed, and unemployed. 

The Concessionary tier is priced at $64/month, and includes 9 hours/week access and 22L of storage. We may ask for proof of eligibility.

If you prefer to trade labour for membership, we have a [Volunteer scheme](/volunteer).
