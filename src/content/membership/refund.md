We bill monthly, so we don’t do partial refunds for less than a month. 

If you’ve paid upfront for a year and need to switch to monthly, we’ve got you covered:

- The refund will be calculated as if you were originally paying monthly.
- We will deduct the monthly rate for each month you've used, including the current month.
- If you paid using credit card, we will deduct 5% from the total refund amount to cover our payment processing costs.
- The remaining balance will be refunded to your original payment method, or to a bank account of your choice if that is not possible.

To request a refund or change your payment terms, please send an email to [membership@hackerspace.sg](mailto:membership@hackerspace.sg?subject=Refund%20of%20HackerspaceSG%20Membership).

Please allow a few weeks for processing (up to 6 months if the refund amount is large enough to impact our day-to-day operations).
